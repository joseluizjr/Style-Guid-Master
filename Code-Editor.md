# Code Editor

To facilitate our patterns and style guide throughout all MZ projects, we enforce the use of VS Code as our code editor.

## VS Code

  While there are many excellent code editors out there, we have decided on using VS Code. [`Download it here.`](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - Is free and open source.
  - Supports multiple programming languages.
  - Runs on Linux, Mac and Windows.
  > While all MZ developers should be using VS Code, we are open to suggestions. Suggestions can be made to `Daniel Tiziani` or `Mateus Tavares` on slack.

## Required Plugins

  The following plugins should be installed on all VS Code editors. These are meant to maintain our code quality and standards.

  - [`ESLint`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
  - [`Prettier - Code formatter`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
